# Mission Control

Mission Control is the Workforce metrics page.

## Purpose

Mission Control provides a top-level read of:

- gateway online/offline state
- pending decision count
- schedule lag indicators
- autonomy mode distribution across roster seats
- policy outcomes for recent runs (`allow`, `block`, `escalate`)
- risk distribution for recent runs (`low`, `medium`, `high`)

## Scope

- Metrics only
- No direct mutating actions
- Use Workforce or AppFolio Workspace tabs for operational actions
